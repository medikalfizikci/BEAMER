``Each day is an opportunity to say something honestly, to make somthing more beautiful, to create somthing precious, to give a gift only we can provide for the family of the earth. To dedicate a single act to the healing of others is a day well lived.``~\cite{muller}

Mark 12
\begin{verse}
28 One of the teachers of the law† came and heard them debating. Noticing that Jesus had given them a good answer, he asked him, “Of all the commandments, which is the most important?” \\
29 “The most important one,” answered Jesus, “is this: ‘Hear, O Israel, the Lord our God, the Lord is one.\\
30 Love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your mind and with all your strength.’\\
31 The second is this: ‘Love your neighbor as yourself.’ There is no commandment greater than these.” \\
